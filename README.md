# ESP32-Bike-Powermeter
A small proof of concept program which mimics a real bicycle power meter using fake values.
Fully compliant with the BLE Standard, visible by any phone bike app.

## Controlling power and cadence
To controll the transmitted power and cadence, connect a potentiometer (10K Ohm, P103 306E)
between 3V, GND and the middle pin to:
* 34 - power
* 39 - cadence
